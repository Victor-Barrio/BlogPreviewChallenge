## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned the Mobile-first workflow to work on this project, and is a great way to do it. This project give me one problem when I was doing the icon and name of the author section, the flexbox propert didn't work, and when i put the margin to 0 it's woking correctly. I'm learning a lot of things about CSS and HTML, I'm really happy with the result.

### Continued development

I want to continue working with the Mobile-first workflow to made my future projects easier.
